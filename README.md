# Data Science Projects
This repo is a collection of all my Data Science Projects. 

EDA - Lending Club Case Study
> This case study is based on Lending Club Dataset. Based on the available data set, we are required to draw insights which help in categorizing a new customer.
> The objective of this case study is to analyze the data to identify customers who might default the loan.

# Advanced Linear Regression
> A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data is provided in the CSV file below.
The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
The company wants to know:
Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
How well those variables describe the price of a house.
Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

Business Goal 
You are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

Malicious URL Detection
> The aim of this project is to classify a URL as a Malicious or Benign URL.

> Collected a public dataset that consists of 450176 rows and two classes of URLs: Malicious or Benign. Have extracted a total of 17 features which consist of Lexical features, count-based features, and two binary features.

> Trained the model on Adaboost and Random Forest classifiers and used the Voting Classifier ensembling method to get the optimum result among the two classifiers
